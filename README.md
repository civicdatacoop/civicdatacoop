## Imagine

A vibrant, civic data environment so health-related data about our citizens works for our citizens. 
Based on a collaborative, open approach the CDC will support people and organisations use data to:

* Translate lived experience into insight, 
* Deliver innovation with impact,
* Test models for ethical, inclusive use of health data

We believe in being transparent about our programme. Information and papers that are ready to be shared, reused and remixed will be shared here.

In the meantime, if you are interested in knowing more about how we are developing, our active documents are here:
