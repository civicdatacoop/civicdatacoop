## Imagine

A vibrant, civic data environment so health-related data about our citizens works for our citizens. 
Based on a collaborative, open approach the CDC will support people and organisations use data to:

* Translate lived experience into insight, 
* Deliver innovation with impact,
* Test models for ethical, inclusive use of health data

We believe in being transparent about our programme. Our active documents are in development here using Notion:
